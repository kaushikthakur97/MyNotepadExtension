## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive

*   **State Management**: The application state (including all notes, deleted notes, sort order, and selected theme) is managed in JavaScript variables within the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.
*   **Data Persistence**: `chrome.storage.local.set()` is used to save the state, and `chrome.storage.local.get()` retrieves it when the extension is opened.
*   **Theming with CSS Variables**: The extension leverages CSS custom properties (variables) for all its themes. JavaScript cycles through a list of theme names, applying a corresponding class (e.g., `dark-mode`, `slate-mode`, `glassmorphism-mode`) to the `<body>` element. This makes adding or modifying themes clean and scalable.
*   **Rich Text Editing**: The editor leverages the native `contentEditable` attribute on a `<div>`, and formatting is applied using the `document.execCommand()` API for both standard styles and new features like text/highlight coloring.
*   **Debounced Saving**: To optimize performance, user input triggers a `setTimeout` function. This `debounce` mechanism ensures that the `saveData()` function is only called after the user has paused typing for 500ms.
*   **Note Export**: The export feature converts a note's HTML content into plain text, creates a `Blob` (a file-like object), and then generates a temporary `<a>` link to trigger a user download of the `.txt` file.
