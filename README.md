## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive

*   **State Management**: The application state (including all notes, deleted notes, sort order, and selected theme) is managed in JavaScript variables within the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.
*   **Data Persistence**: `chrome.storage.local.set()` is used to save the state, and `chrome.storage.local.get()` retrieves it when the extension is opened, ensuring a seamless user experience.
*   **Theming with CSS Variables**: The extension leverages CSS custom properties for its themes. JavaScript cycles through theme names, applying a corresponding class (e.g., `dark-mode`, `glassmorphism-mode`) to the `<body>`. The Glassmorphism theme utilizes the `backdrop-filter` property for a modern blur effect.
*   **Rich Text Editing**: The editor is built on a `contentEditable` `<div>`, with formatting applied via the `document.execCommand()` API for robust, native browser support.
*   **Screenshot & Clipboard API**: The capture feature uses `chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab` to generate a PNG data URL. This image is then written to the user's clipboard using the modern `navigator.clipboard.write()` API with a `ClipboardItem`.
*   **Debounced Saving**: To optimize performance, user input on the title or editor triggers a `setTimeout` function. This `debounce` mechanism ensures that the `saveData()` function is only called 500ms after the user has paused typing.
*   **Note Export**: The export feature converts a note's HTML content into plain text, creates a `Blob` (a file-like object), and then generates a temporary `<a>` link to trigger a user download of the `.txt` file.
