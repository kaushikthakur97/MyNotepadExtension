## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive

*   **State Management**: The application state (including all notes, deleted notes, sort order, and selected theme) is managed in JavaScript variables within the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.
*   **Data Persistence**: `chrome.storage.local.set()` is used to save the state, and `chrome.storage.local.get()` retrieves it when the extension is opened. This provides a reliable and fast way to store data.
*   **Dynamic Rendering**: The note list and recycle bin views are generated dynamically in JavaScript. Functions like `renderNotesList()` and `showRecycleBinView()` create HTML elements based on the current state and append them to the DOM, ensuring the UI is always up-to-date.
*   **Theming with CSS Variables**: The extension uses CSS custom properties (variables) for theming. A `dark-mode` class is toggled on the `<body>` element, and all color properties are defined through variables, making the theme switch clean and efficient.
*   **Debounced Saving**: To optimize performance and avoid hitting storage write limits, user input (title and content changes) triggers a `setTimeout` function. This `debounce` mechanism ensures that the `saveData()` function is only called after the user has paused typing for 500ms.
*   **Rich Text Editing**: The editor leverages the native `contentEditable` attribute on a `<div>`, and formatting is applied using the `document.execCommand()` API.
